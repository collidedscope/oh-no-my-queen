# oh-no-my-queen

Losing your Queen during a game of chess usually sucks; this userscript gives you the last laugh by automatically resigning if and when your Queen gets taken (unless of course you can counter by taking their Queen and/or checkmating their King).

Astonish your reginicidal maniac of an opponent with how quickly you're able to admit defeat!

## Usage

With a [userscript manager](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) installed, visiting [onmq.user.js](https://github.com/collidedscope/oh-no-my-queen/raw/master/onmq.user.js) should prompt you for installation. After that, simply go about the business of hanging your Queen and revel in the bewilderment of your enemies.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Support servers other than lichess
- [ ] Provide button to toggle instead of (or in addition to?) disable
- [x] Resign only if the material imbalance is sufficiently high?
